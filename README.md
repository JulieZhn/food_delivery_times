# What may influence food delivery time in the U.S.? 🥐 🧀 🍔 🍟 🥟
### This projects aim to explore the relationship between some variables — the types of vehicles used, the road density level, weather conditions, and types of orders — with the average amount of time taken for delivery in the U.S. 

From data analysis, here are **my findings**:

- There was not much difference in average delivery times across the four vehicle types employed for delivery, from around 24 to 27 minutes taken per order. Electric scooters emerge as the swiftest option, averaging less than 25 minutes.
- Across four road density levels—low, medium, high, and jammed—the delivery times ranged from approximately 21 to 31 minutes. As traffic density increases, the average delivery time also extends.
- Sunny weather: order completed under 22 minutes on average; sandstorms, storms, or windy: around 26 minutes; Cloudy or foggy weather: around 29 minutes.
- No variation in average delivery times across various types of orders, such as meals, snacks, buffets, and drinks, which all take around 26 minutes.

**Data Collection**:
From Gaurav Malik, [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gauravmalik26/food-delivery-dataset/data) posted on Kaggle. 

**Data Analysis**:
I used pivot tables in Excel, picking the variable as rows and taken time as values. Then I put the table into Datawrapper to make the charts. 

**New Learnings**:
I enhanced my multiple skills in dataset searching, data analysis with Excel, data visualization with Datawrapper, and HTML file holding a webpage.

**Improvements I could make**:
If I got more time, I may can find a more complete dataset with more variables, for instance, delivery fees and tips, and to find their relationships with delivery time. I can also interview some delivery workers to get more reportings done and make the piece more journalistic.
